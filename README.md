The repository for the most interesting projects made during Applied Mathematics studies

# Master studies

## Partial Differential Equations
Stefan problem - model that describes the heat transfer and phase change phenomena occurring at the interface (a boundary moving in time) between a solid and a liquid during melting process. Included file contains both mathematical analysis of the problem and numerical simulations using python.

## Diffusion processes
Threshold q-voter model - agent based model that describes opinion dynamics on a complex network (Random graph, Watts-Strogatz model and Barabassi-Albert model were used). Included files contain python code used for simulations and final presentation that concludes the results.

## Computer Simulations of Stochastic Processes
There are three reports on different topics from the stochastic processes field, among others Fractional Brownian Motion or alpha stable distribution.

## Data Mining
The pdf files included contain a comprehensive analysis of the spambase dataset with exploratory dataset analysis, classification algorithms (part 1), principal component analysis and clustering algorithms (part 2) all performed using R language.

## Optimization theory
Folder contains solutions for a Linear Programming Problem (python) and a Nonlinear Programming problem (matlab) with task descriptions provided.

## Machine Learning
The course focused mainly on different types of neural networks and their structure. As there were many different tasks, there's a dedicated repository, where all the implementations can be found, including a neural network implementation from scratch.
